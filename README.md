# CDC-Projects

From 2017 to 2018, I worked as a data fello at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
I was the sole personnel in the Chronic Viral Diseases Branch responsible for consolidating assay results 
of different projects into a single relational SQL database and automating summary report creation to track
more nuanced trends and for more frequent monitoring reports using R. I proposed and executed analyses to 
show the efficacy of automating a report generation process for assay results using statistical packages that I created.
